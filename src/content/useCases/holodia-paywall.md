## My role

As the sole Product Owner at Holodia, I worked with our multidisciplinary team and our founders to set the product strategy and design the roadmap. I conducted user research, user interviews, designed a new onboarding experience, designed a new AR experience from scratch, and worked closely with the CEO, the COO, and the lead engineer.

## Product

Holofit is a VR fitness app with a subscription model designed to motivate users to work out using rowing machines, bikes, ellipticals, and freestyle modes.

## Problem definition

By analyzing the data, we identified significant issues with first-time users understanding what Holofit could offer. Users initially started on a menu and were recommended a combo workout, a workout for users without a machine, regardless of whether they had a fitness machine. User feedback revealed that many users were unaware of the various gameplays available and struggled to collect trophies. Data from Amplitude showed that many first-time users uninstalled the app shortly after a brief play session. Additionally, most complaints on the Meta store were about the app being a paid subscription without a free option or trial mode.

## Solution

We began by redesigning the paywall to make it more modern and user-friendly. After testing various copies for the Demo option, we found that "Limited Free Plan" resonated better with potential users. The previous Demo plan limited playtime to 5 minutes per day; this restriction was removed. Instead, new users could access two unlocked Holoworlds for unlimited play but encountered a new paywall upon exiting the Holoworld.

A video showcasing various Holoworlds was added to the left side of the paywall, while a carousel with user reviews was added to the right, making it more visually appealing and informative.

Additionally, we created a comprehensive onboarding experience tailored to two types of users: those with fitness machines and those using freestyle mode. The onboarding showcased the most popular gameplays that Holofit offered across different environments.

## Metrics

- 36% increase in the conversion rate for freestyle users after releasing the new onboarding.
- 11% increase in the conversion rate for machine users after releasing the new onboarding.
- 117.7% increase in the average time spent per user in their first 28 days using the app compared to the previous year.

## Key takeaways

- Understanding user pain points and addressing them effectively can significantly enhance user engagement and retention.
- Tailoring experiences for distinct user segments, such as machine users and freestyle users, ensures a more personalized and effective onboarding process.
- Iterative testing and refining, such as with the Demo option copy and paywall design, are crucial for optimizing user conversion.
- A visually appealing and informative interface, such as adding videos and user reviews, can positively impact user perception and decision-making.
- Leveraging data insights to guide decisions leads to measurable improvements in key metrics like conversion rates and user engagement.
