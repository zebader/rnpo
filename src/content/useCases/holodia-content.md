## My role

As the sole Lead Product Manager at Holodia, I led the strategy and execution of
initiatives focused on increasing long-term engagement and subscription value.

I worked closely with founders, engineering, and design to redesign how content
was released, experienced, and rewarded, with the goal of improving retention and
lifetime value in a subscription-based product.

## Product

Holofit is a VR fitness application built around immersive environments and
gamified workouts, monetised through a monthly subscription.
Sustained engagement is critical to the business model, as long-term usage
directly drives customer lifetime value.

## Business & Problem Definition

While Holofit attracted users through immersive environments, data analysis
and user research revealed a major engagement risk.
Most users treated environments as one-off experiences:

- Users explored a new world once or twice and then disengaged.
- Content novelty wore off quickly.
- Progression felt shallow.
- There were limited incentives to return to previously completed experiences.

As a result, usage patterns showed declining session frequency over time,
limiting the long-term value of subscriptions.

From a business perspective, this created three risks:

- Reduced perceived value of the subscription.
- Lower long-term engagement.
- Higher likelihood of churn once novelty faded.

To scale sustainably, Holofit needed to transform content from
“single-use experiences” into long-term engagement loops.

## Strategy

My objective was to increase content replayability and progression depth
without significantly increasing production costs.
The strategy focused on three pillars:

- Extend the lifespan of existing content.
- Introduce long-term progression and goals.
- Encourage repeated exploration of environments.

This approach aimed to maximise return on existing content investment
while strengthening retention drivers.

## Solution

### 1. Multi-Stage Content Releases

Instead of releasing environments as fully unlocked experiences,
we introduced staged content rollouts.

- New features and routes were unlocked over time.
- Users were encouraged to revisit environments.
- Content felt continuously “fresh” without new asset creation.

This created recurring engagement triggers and reduced early content exhaustion.

### 2. Dynamic Environment Variations

We introduced environmental variations such as:

- Day and night cycles
- Weather conditions
- Alternative routes

These changes increased perceived variety and made repeat sessions
feel meaningfully different.

### 3. Reward and Progression System

To reinforce long-term motivation, we redesigned the reward system.

- Added collectible trophies and achievements.
- Linked rewards to consistent usage.
- Encouraged exploration across multiple environments.

This shifted user behaviour from passive consumption to goal-oriented engagement.

## Metrics

These initiatives significantly improved long-term engagement
and product value perception:

- **+36.7% increase in average monthly time spent per user (YoY)**
- Strong uplift in repeat sessions and environment revisits
- Increased depth of progression across user cohorts

By extending the lifecycle of existing content, the product
delivered more value per user without proportional increases in development cost.

## Business Impact

This work strengthened Holofit’s subscription model by:

- Increasing perceived value of membership
- Encouraging habitual usage
- Improving return on content investment
- Supporting long-term revenue stability

It enabled the company to scale engagement without relying
solely on continuous new content production.

## Key takeaways

- In subscription products, engagement depth is as critical as acquisition.
- Extending content lifespan can unlock significant business value.
- Progression systems are powerful drivers of long-term behaviour.
- Retention strategy should be embedded in product design, not added later.
- Maximising ROI on existing assets is essential in resource-constrained teams.
