## My role

As a freelance Product Manager at Multiestetica, I worked with designers, developers, stakeholders, and UX expert Adrián Espinosa to improve the website’s user experience and engagement. My responsibilities included conducting user research, analyzing behavioral data, defining product requirements, and leading the discovery and delivery of a unified search experience.

## Product

Multiestetica is a **lead generation platform** in the aesthetic and medical treatments space. It connects users with clinics and doctors by helping them discover treatments, read real patient experiences, and submit enquiries.

Most users arrived via Google on specific content pages, such as treatment articles or user experiences.

## Problem definition

From a user experience perspective, navigating Multiestetica required too much effort.

Through user interviews and Hotjar session recordings, we observed that:

- Users struggled to move between related content
- Finding relevant doctors, treatments, or experiences took multiple steps
- Navigation paths were not intuitive
- Users often got stuck on a single page
- Many left the site without exploring further

This was especially problematic because:

- Around 80% of users arriving through organic search only viewed one page
- High-intent users who wanted more information or to submit a lead had difficulty finding what they needed

The platform had valuable content, but users couldn’t easily discover or connect it in a way that supported conversion.

## Solution

To reduce navigation friction and support lead generation, we introduced a **unified search experience.**

I led the product discovery and requirement definition, while Adrián Espinosa provided UX expertise to shape the interaction and interface. Together, we designed and prioritized a global search bar that allowed users to:

- Search across doctors, treatments, and experiences
- Find relevant information in one place
- Discover related content without complex navigation

**Key steps:**

- Conducted user interviews to understand search behavior and intent
- Analyzed Hotjar recordings to identify friction points
- Defined clear functional requirements for the search experience
- Collaborated closely with UX and engineering to ensure clarity, usability, and performance

The new search experience reduced user effort and improved the path from content discovery to decision-making and enquiry.

## Metrics

After launching the unified search experience, Multiestetica saw:

- Higher engagement across organic traffic
- Lower bounce rates on key pages
- Increased navigation between related content
- Better support for users with strong intent to convert

## Key takeaways

- UX improvements directly impact lead generation performance
- Reducing navigation friction increases conversion opportunities
- SEO traffic needs strong discovery paths, not just good content
- Observing real user behavior reveals critical funnel blockers
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration creates better product outcomes
